The Index of Biotic Integrity (Fish IBI) is a set of biological metrics used to assess the richness of fish species by comparing the species present at a site to the species that would be expected in the absence of human impacts.
The Fish IBI was adapted to New Zealand in 2004 to account for the unique attributes of New Zealand freshwater fish, such as low species diversity and a high proportion of migratory species.

Fish IBI was incorporated as an attribute in the [National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/national-policy-statement-for-freshwater-management-2020/) (NPS-FM) in 2020.
The NPS-FM requires regional councils to sample fish abundance to calculate IBI scores and, at a minimum, develop action plans to achieve target states determined in consultation with communities.

This calculator was developed to assist practitioners in calculating Fish IBI scores. More information and guidance on using this tool can be found at (xxx).
